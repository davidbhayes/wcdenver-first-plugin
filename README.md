# Making Your First Plugin at WordCamp Denver 2017

This repository will hold the steps we'll take in the "Making Your First WordPress Plugin" workshop.

## What We'll Talk About Before We Start

* What experience does everyone have with WordPress and making plugins?
* What is a WordPress plugin? What kinds of things can they do?
* What is PHP? OOP?
* What role do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have in WordPress plugins?

## The steps we'll take are as follows

1. Create a plugin by putting the main file in the repo. We'll follow the common convention (which isn't required by WordPress) that the folder name and the primary-file name are the same. We'll add the plugin header to that: https://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header#Plugin_File_Header_Example

## Credits

This repository, idea, and much of the code is cribbed from a workshop run by the Fort Collins WordPress Meetup in 2016, which was presented by me with @greenhornet79, @amberhinds, @mikeselendar, and Michael Launer. The repository for that event is https://github.com/amberhinds/fcwp-testimonials. To follow the basic flow of that workshop, the &name%-notes.md files were presented in this order:

1. Jeremy -- https://github.com/amberhinds/fcwp-testimonials/blob/master/jeremy-notes.md
2. Amber -- https://github.com/amberhinds/fcwp-testimonials/blob/master/amber-notes.md
3. David -- https://github.com/amberhinds/fcwp-testimonials/blob/master/david-notes.md
4. Mike -- https://github.com/amberhinds/fcwp-testimonials/blob/master/mike-notes.md
